Enrollment Trends Analysis for Texas Public Universities (2021-2023)

After completing a SQL course, I wanted to apply what I learned through a hands-on project. I chose to analyze student enrollment trends for Texas public universities from 2021 to 2023.

Tools used:

- SQL for data extraction and manipulation
- Python for data visualization (Matplotlib and Pandas)

For a detailed analysis and insights, please download the accompanying Word document: "SQL Project: Enrollment Trends Analysis."

Thank you,

Andrea Sanchez
